BreakEven
=========

A simple Budget Tracker for Android

My first entry into the Android Development world.


Feature List:

- [x] Transaction History (Value/ comment/ internal date)
- [x] Sliding Views with Fragments (ViewPager)
- [x] Remove Transactions from list via context menu (long press)
- [ ] Edit Transactions (functionality lost when moving to fragments/viewpager)
- [ ] Multiple budget profiles
- [ ] Color coded transactions
- [ ] Pie chart of colored categories
- [ ] Date filtering for transactions
- [ ] Search transaction comments?
- [ ] Sorting? (unlikely, chronological makes sense..)
